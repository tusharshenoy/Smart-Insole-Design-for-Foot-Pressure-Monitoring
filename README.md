# Smart Insole Design for Foot Pressure Monitoring

### Title: Smart Insole Design for Foot Pressure Monitoring
### 1. Abstract
   The project `"Smart Insole Design for Foot Pressure Monitoring"` introduces an innovative and cost-effective system designed to continuously monitor foot pressure using `capacitive sensors` embedded within an insole. Foot pressure monitoring is crucial for diagnosing conditions like diabetic neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, and peripheral vascular diseases. Existing monitoring techniques are limited in their capacity for prolonged use and can be costly, hindering widespread adoption.

The proposed system utilizes an array of capacitive sensors made from copper foil, enabling real-time monitoring of foot pressure. These sensors are strategically arranged across the insole to cover critical areas susceptible to deformities, facilitating the detection and analysis of pressure distribution. Data collected from these sensors is processed using a `Raspberry Pi Pico microprocessor`, which applies an algorithm to determine pressure distribution, identify potential deformity-prone areas, and transmit the findings to a monitoring device.

Experimental testing involved a group of volunteers, providing insights into foot pressure characteristics among individuals with different foot conditions. The system displayed the ability to visualize foot pressure variations through a color-coded map, indicating areas of high, moderate, and low pressure.

The project's novel approach using affordable, capacitive sensors in a wearable insole, along with the ability to process and visualize pressure data in real-time, distinguishes it from existing monitoring systems. The documentation includes detailed descriptions of sensor selection, arrangement, data processing, experimental results, and a comparative analysis with similar existing models. Additionally, the documentation aims to provide a basis for further enhancements and improvements to the system.

### 2. Introduction
#### Introduction to Foot Pressure Monitoring
Foot pressure monitoring plays a crucial role in `evaluating foot health`, providing significant insights into `gait kinematics`, `ground reaction forces`, and identifying various foot conditions. It is essential for medical diagnostics, enabling differentiation between normal and pathological foot conditions. This monitoring method is pivotal in diagnosing and tracking medical conditions such as `diabetic neuropathy`, `plantar fasciitis`, and `peripheral vascular diseases`. Early detection is vital for effective treatment, making foot pressure monitoring a valuable tool in this context.

### Detailed Description of Sensor Selection
The proposed pressure sensor uses a `capacitive sensing mechanism designed with thin copper foil` due to its `conductive properties` and availability. The active plate, responsible for sensing changes in capacitance, is divided into `16 individual circular segments`, `ensuring precise measurements` and `reducing interference from adjacent regions`. These segments are `strategically positioned` across the insole to cover the `heels, toes, and mid-foot regions`. A `reference/common plate` and a `dielectric layer` made of plastic foam separate the active plates, providing a baseline capacitance and compensating for environmental factors influencing measurements.

### Data Processing Workflow
The `Raspberry Pi Pico` reads the voltage from each sensor through the `analogue multiplexer` and processes the data. It collects voltage readings `128 times` within 2 seconds, discarding initial and final readings to avoid noise. A `filtering algorithm` calculates the average of the remaining 64 values for each sensor. This process is repeated 10 times to obtain a 16x10 matrix. The resulting average values enhance accuracy. The processed data is visualized and transmitted to a monitoring device for real-time analysis.

This systematic approach of sensor selection, arrangement, and data processing ensures comprehensive foot pressure monitoring, enabling early detection and continuous surveillance of foot conditions.

### Characteristics of Test Subjects
The participants included individuals with different foot statuses, such as:
- Normal foot: 6 subjects, average age 19 years, average weight 66 Kgs
- Pes Planus (flat foot): 3 subjects, average age 30 years, average weight 72 Kgs
- Pes Cavus (high arch foot): 1 subject, age 19 years, weight 61 Kgs
- Metatarsus Varus: 1 subject, age 39 years, weight 67 Kgs

### Visualization and Interpretation of Results
The collected data from the volunteer participants allowed the observation of foot deformities and pressure variations. The voltage readings plotted for each participant from the 16 sensors showed distinct patterns. Individuals with different foot conditions exhibited varied pressure distributions across the sensors. For instance, a typical foot applied less pressure on certain sensors, indicating specific foot areas experiencing lower pressure. Conversely, individuals with flat feet applied more uniform pressure across all sensors. Additionally, a volunteer with a foot deformity showed reduced pressure readings on specific sensors, indicating uneven pressure distribution on the foot.

The system's ability to visualize and interpret pressure distribution patterns among individuals with various foot conditions highlights its potential for diagnostic and analytical purposes, enabling the identification and analysis of foot irregularities and pressure variations.
